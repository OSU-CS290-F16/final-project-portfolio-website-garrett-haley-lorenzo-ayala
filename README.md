This project will be a fully functioning webpage which dynamically creates new posts, updates and retrieves information from an MySQL database for two different users.
The work for the project was split between Lorenzo Ayala and Garrett Haley.

Lorenzo Ayala: Created the client and server side javascript interactions, and rendering of the pages with the proper information. Also established the connection with the database with the proper queries. 

Garrett Haley: Created the MySQL database which we utilized to display the user information, edited the basic css to create a unique design to the program, created the json files for the program, created the about page interaction, and performed all of the local commits to github.

installs needed:
npm mysql
